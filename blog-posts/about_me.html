          <span class="byline">
            At first I started learning how to code purely by curiosity. I'm driven by things I don't understand, that's why I thrive on learning new stuff all the time.
          </span>
        </header>
        <p>
          I've recently graduated in Electrical Engineering in Brazil. It was a 5 year college, when I focused my spare time into learning everything I could about Financial Markets, once I was hypnotized by the siren song of the rich wannabes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until I finally started a summer internship at a brokerage firm that was about to become the largest one for Individuals in Brazil. By that time they were expanding their business to NYC and then I got an exciting opportunity to work at the International Desk. However, as exciting I thought the subject was, my experience there weren't so great. The office culture was so futile and all I could hear about all day long was how people made money fast and how they spent it even faster! My excitement slowly faded away and I decided to try something else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, I had the chance to participate in a highly competitive process to be an intern at Procter & Gamble at the Finance department, which I succeded. There I understood the concept of office politics and was turned off once more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, I realized that my main concern is not how much money I can make or how prestigious is the company I work for. Instead, I do prioritize being able to do stuff that matter for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's when I decided to work with technology and decided to pursue a Master's in the US, so I could get in touch with what is going on in the heart of the developed world. So, I took the leap and came here to get deep into Power Electronics, which was my study focus at college. That's when I got a job as a programmer at the school Lab when I participated into a really cool Wireless Charging of Electric Vehicles project that was going on there at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got amused with the possibilities of creation when programming and then started to learn as much as I could about it! As a result, I finally realized that I wanted to be a developer as it would give me the power to create whatever I wanted and even better, I would be able to do that with my own hands!
        </p>
        <p>
          So here I am now. Giving my best to be able to create something meaninful and fulfilling for me. I can't express how excited I feel right now. I've never felt this sense of control over my life, as I finally feel I can do something that gives me real pleasure!
