				<h3>What are the great things about JavaScript? Why is it so popular?</h3>
				<ol>
					<p>JavaScript is popular among Web Developers mainly due to 4 great features:</p>
					<li>Browser support:</li>
					<p>You don't have to install any plugin to access its content, as flash would for instance. All browsers have adopted JavaScript as a scripting language and they provide integrated support for it.</p>
					<li>Can be used on client side as well as on server side:</li>
					<p>This characteristic by itself explain why there are so many JavaScript developers.</p>
					<li>Functional programming language:</li>
					<p>In javascript, function could be assigned to variables just like any other data types. Not only that, but a function can accept another function as a parameter and can also return a function. You can have functions with no name as well. Clearly, this gives you the ability to code in functional programming style.</p>
					<li>Support for objects:</li>
					<p>Javascript is an object oriented language. However, the way javascript handles objects and inheritance is bit different from conventional object oriented programming languages like Java. Due to this, javascript supports most of the object oriented concepts while being simple to learn and use.</p>
				</ol>
				<h3>What are it's limitations?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>JavaScript cannot write to files on the server without the help of a server side script.</li>
					<li>JavaScript cannot access databases unless you use Ajax and have a server side script perform the database accesses for you.</li>
					<li>JavaScript cannot read from or write to files in the client.</li>
					<li>JavaScript cannot close a window if it didn't open it.</li>
					<li>JavaScript cannot access web pages hosted on another domain.</li>
					<li>JavaScript cannot protect your page source or images.</li>
				</ul>
