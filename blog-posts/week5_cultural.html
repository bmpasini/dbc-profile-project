			<p>My biggest fear about coming to DBC is not knowing if after the course ends and after I get a job as a Software Developer I'll realize that this wasn't what I was expecting and have to start all over again the search for something that gives me pleasure. So far I am excited about being a programmer, but I was excited once also when I started working in financial markets. At that time I also got deep into the subject, but after 2 years I discovered that the culture of the people in that field didn't fit well with mine. Then I was lost for a while, until now that I found pleasure in programming.</p>
