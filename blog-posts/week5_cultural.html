			<h1>Pair Programming</h1>
			<h2>How I Felt When Pair Programming</h2>
			<p>It really depended on the person I was pairing with. There was people who really helped me seeing the challenge from another perspective, helping me to learn. Often, these people were also willing to listen to my ideas and consider them as a possible solution. In the other hand, there was people who weren't helpful at all. Specially, when I needed their help because I was bit late with the content. There was a guy who wanted to do all the work by himself because he thought I wouldn't know anything, as I was a bit behind with the challenges.</p>
			<h2>How I Felt When Receiving Feedbacks</h2>
			<p>Most of the feedbacks I received were thanking me for being easy to work with, which made me glad and motivated to me in a way that was beneficial for my learning.</p>
			<p>Their suggestions were about some things I suspected I could improve and their feedback confirmed them. Essentially, people were saying that I could improve my driver/navigator skills, which I believe would only be possible by practicing. Also, I was suggested to use the IRB, since so far I've been just using the command "ruby" on the Terminal.</p>
			<h2>How I Felt When Writing Feedbacks</h2>
			<p>Particularly I don't like to give feedback when I'm not so sure of what I'm saying. Thus, my feedbacks are generally pretty straightforward and sincere. I don't like to point out people's flaws because I know I can also make the same mistakes.</p>
			<h2>My Thoughts on Pairing and Feedback</h2>
			<p> I think that pairing and giving feedback is a fairly common practice among professional developers. So, I'd better get good at it.</p>
