<!-- Claude M. Steele has spent his life researching minority underachievement and developed a theory called "Stereotype Threat." Conduct your own research about stereotype threat. Identify times when you felt it. How did it affect your achievement? What questions did you ask yourself? Did you feel it physically? If you don't think you've ever felt it, can you imagine some groups that might? What could you do to help others in that situation? -->

				<h1>The Stereotype Threat</h1>
				<p>Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group. This term was first used by Steele and Aronson (1995) who showed in several experiments that Black college freshmen and sophomores performed more poorly on standardized tests than White students when their race was emphasized. When race was not emphasized, however, Black students performed better and equivalently with White students. The results showed that performance in academic contexts can be harmed by the awareness that one's behavior might be viewed through the lens of racial stereotypes.</p>
				<h2>When I Experienced Stereotype Threat</h2>
				<p>I'm a born and raised Brazilian who has been living in the US for 6 months and I can say that sometimes I am treated as a minority. However, I'm lucky to be in New York City which is a place that so many foreigners live at, and my culture is doesn't differ so much from the American one as some other cultures from people who live here.</p>
				<p>Honestly, I felt more the Stereotype Threat when I started working in different companies. As people don't know me, they usually have very low expectations and also, I don't that I'm too good promoting myself. I don't like doing it, I always prefer that people discover my qualities by themselves, because it's natural for me acting humbly and with simplicity. So I can't help to think that people who are constantly trying to show off are so stupid.</p>
				<p>When these situations happened I felt like someone was treating me as a dumb, ore more importantly, giving me dumb jobs to do and I really don't like it. It demotivates me so much. My last job was in a huge consumer goods company, worldwide known, which is Procter & Gamble and in that period of my life I never felt more useless and unproductive as I was assigned tasks that even a monkey could do. As a result, I got completely demotivated and didn't even want to go to work, so when the clock strucked 6pm, I was the first guy to clean my desk and leave no matter what.</p>
				<p>Thus, I can say by self experience that being treated with underestimation can be extremely hindering for you and undermines both your capacity and interest, specially in the workplace.</p>
