			<h3>My expectations about Dev Bootcamp</h3>
			<p>I'm exciting about making part of this community. I am looking forward to learn programming with different people who are also engaged on doing that.</p>
			<p>I truly think that we will be responsible for our learning and that we should engage ourselves on making this experience the best possible. I'm thrilled to know that Dev Bootcamp doesn't teach like a traditional school and I am confident that this different culture will push us to learn more than ever.</p>
