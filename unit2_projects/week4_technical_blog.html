			<h3>Google</h3>
			<p>It may be the favorite website of most internet users, despite many of them not even being aware of it. It is simple, elegant and highly efficient. The internet is so practical these days mostly because of it. I don't have to know any URLs anymore. I just type whatever I am looking for and Google sends me to it.</p>
			<h3>Quora</h3>
			<p>It's a Q&A website with a community of well informed users, which makes easy to find intellingent answers to various types of questions. I can spend hours on it, almost like when go to a library for a whole afternoon, just looking for different interesting things to read.</p>
			<h3>Netflix</h3>
			<p>The best thing to do in a boring evening when you don't know how to get distracted. Browse through it for a little while to find quality entertainment in almost no time.</p>
